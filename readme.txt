Parameter extraction for a superconducting thermal switch (hTron) SPICE model (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12360)
- The hTron model is located in hTron_behavioral.lib, with symbol hTron_behavioral.asy.
- hTron_behavioral_debug.asc is a more graphic way to represent the model, and can be used for debugging.
- test_circuit.asc performs the I-V curve of an hTron. Two different device geometries can be tested by changing the sub-circuit parameters.
- test_circuit_pulse.asc performs the simulation presented in Figure S4 of the Supplemental Material (a heater current pulse in a DC current-biased device).
